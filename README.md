This script automates the process of checking sequences for correctness after transforming bacteria with the BP reaction during Gateway Cloning.

Required inputs:

1. designs: A spreadsheet listing the DNA inserts flanked by attB sites which were used for the BP reaction. The spreadsheet additionally lists the names of samples which were sequenced. For example, the following format would be used for three samples: 2A1;2A2;2A3

2. sequencing_results: A spreadsheet containing the sequencing results for all samples.

Note that this script would need to be adjusted depending on the donor vector used and formatting of the sequencing results spreadsheet.

Doonor vector: pDO23A
